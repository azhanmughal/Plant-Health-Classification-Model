# Plant-Health-Classification-Model
This repository contains code and documentation for a Plant Health Classification Model developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is designed to classify images of plants as either healthy or unhealthy based on visual cues. The repository includes the following components:

Data Import and Preprocessing: 
Code for importing image datasets from Google Drive, preprocessing techniques such as auto-orientation and resizing, as well as data augmentation methods like cropping, rotation, and noise addition.

Model Training:
Training of the CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras. The model architecture includes convolutional layers with ReLU activation, max-pooling layers for feature extraction, and dense layers for classification. The training process involves optimizing binary cross-entropy loss using the Adam optimizer.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluation of the trained model using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. Additionally, visualizations of sample predictions and images with predicted labels are provided.

Documentation: 
Detailed documentation outlining the model architecture, data preprocessing steps, model training process, and performance evaluation metrics. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding and replicating the model.

The Plant Health Classification Model aims to provide a reliable tool for identifying and monitoring the health status of plants based on image data. This repository can be utilized by researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts in the field of agriculture and computer vision for plant health assessment tasks.
